    "viewport" (CSS object) tag ensures that responsive design works as expected.
    Setting the viewport in the HTML ensures that the browser knows how to handle the page's dimensions
    and scaling before any CSS or JavaScript is loaded.
    This can be crucial for performance, especially on mobile devices
    where you want to minimize the amount of zooming and resizing the browser has to do.
